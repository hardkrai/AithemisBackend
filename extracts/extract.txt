Wishing you a Great New Year filled with laughter, and happiness!
With all my wishes and a hearty “Ho Ho Ho”,
I’ve come to know you during my trip at BITS and That is a time
very close to my heart and I am glad you were a part of that, the fun
we had there in the boys hostel was incredible and I hope nothing
but the same for the things that await you in the future.
I wanted the gift to be something fun and also something I wanted
to sincerly gift and recommend you, BUT, kal itni baarish ho gyi ki
plans thode se mess ho gye, still, the things I Wanted to include in
my gift did come through. I hope you like and have fun with what i
have prepared
Merry Christmas from the 5th Block!
